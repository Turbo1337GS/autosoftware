The MessageRepository class is responsible for storing and retrieving messages.

It uses a JSON file to store the messages. The file is located at `__DIR__ . '/../messages.json'`.

To save a message, the class first gets all of the messages from the file. It then adds the new message to the array of messages and saves the array back to the file.

To get all of the messages, the class reads the JSON file and returns the array of messages.

To find a message by its UUID, the class loops through the array of messages and returns the message if it finds a match.

To generate a UUID, the class uses the `Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid` class to create a new UUID.


The Message class is a simple data structure that represents a message. It has three properties:

* uuid: A unique identifier for the message.
* content: The content of the message.
* timestamp: The timestamp of the message.

The class constructor takes three arguments:

* uuid: The unique identifier for the message.
* content: The content of the message.
* timestamp: The timestamp of the message.

The class provides three getter methods to access the properties:

* getUuid(): Returns the unique identifier for the message.
* getContent(): Returns the content of the message.
* getTimestamp(): Returns the timestamp of the message.
