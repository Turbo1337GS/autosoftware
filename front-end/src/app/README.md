This code is for a front-end web page that allows users to create and view messages. The page is built using React, and the messages are stored in a JSON file.

The `Home` component is the main component of the page. It renders a header, a list of messages, and a form for creating new messages. The header contains a title and two buttons for sorting the messages by time or UUID. The list of messages is rendered as a list of `li` elements, each of which contains the message content. The form for creating new messages is rendered as a two-element `div` element, with the input field on the left and the button on the right.

The `useState` hook is used to store the state of the page, such as the list of messages and the selected message. The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch the list of messages from the JSON file when the page loads. The `saveMessage` function is used to create a new message and add it to the list of messages. The `sortMessages` function is used to sort the list of messages by a specified key.

The `Message` type is a TypeScript type that defines the properties of a message. The properties are `uuid`, `content`, and `timestamp`.

The `App` component is the top-level component of the page. It renders the `Home` component.
